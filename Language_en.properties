ExtDesc=Build a Docker Image from a Dockerfile using the IBM Continer Service Build Service on Bluemix and push that 
ExtMessage=Currently we are experiencing problems with the Docker builder in the IBM Container Service.  We are working on this problem and service should be restored shortly.<br><br>(Beta)To leverage this extension you must be enabled for the IBM Container Service on Bluemix. You can verify this by signing into <a href="https://console.ng.bluemix.net/">Bluemix</a>, and selecting 'Create Container'.  Information on the extension can be found on <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/docs/set-up-continuous-delivery-ibm-containers/">IBM Bluemix Dev</a><br><br>Recent changes: Pipeline container build will now clean up old unused images prior to building, if there will be more than IMAGE_LIMIT (default 5) copies after this build.  If you do not want this behavior, please set it to -1 in the environment variables for the build stage configuration.

IMAGE_NAME_KEY=Image Name 
IMAGE_NAME_DESC=The base name of the Docker Image to be created.  This will be used for the name of the built image in the Registry, and in the names for any containers.  This can be set on the job or on as an envrironment property on the stage. 
COMMAND_KEY=Build Script 
COMMAND_DESC=Example script to build a Docker Image on the IBM Container Service.  Use this as is, or update it based on your needs. 

CACHE_KEY=Use cached layers
CACHE_DESC=If false no cached layers will be used when building the image.  This will result in slower build times, but is necessary if there is a layer that has not changed, but needs to go and fetch content. 

ARCHIVE_DIR_KEY=ARCHIVE_DIR_KEY
ARCHIVE_DIR_DESC=Where to put stuff
